# every-vpn-provider
Could not find an actual solid vpn provider list on the internet, so I am gonna make my own.
Submit a pull request to add a vpn provider.
This list will contain only the vpn providers. No additional information besides the name of the VPN and their website.
Update - 
You don't even wanna know how far i had to dig to get this.
